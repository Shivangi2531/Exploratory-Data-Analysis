# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
EDA is an important step in any Data Analysis or Data Science project. EDA is the process of investigating the dataset to discover patterns, and anomalies (outliers), and form hypotheses based on our understanding of the dataset.
In statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach of analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often using statistical graphics and other data visualization methods. A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling and thereby contrasts traditional hypothesis testing.
EDA involves generating summary statistics for numerical data in the dataset and creating various graphical representations to understand the data better.
In this Project we used Python language.
First we have to download the dataset, the dataset I used here is the google playstore dataset, which contains details about the Apps in the play store, there are more than 10,0000+ Apps in the play store. I download it from the Kaggle.
Second step is Data Preparation and Cleaning 
# Data Preparation and Cleaning
Here I loaded the dataset into the data frame, view the columns and rows of the data, perform descriptive statistics to know better about the features inside the dataset, write the observations, finding the missing values and duplicate rows.
Now, the third step is EDA
# Exploratory Analysis and Visualization 
Here I explored each feature(both numerical and Categorical), plot visualizations, deal with the null values and write the observations.
# Summary and Conclusion
1. People are more interested to install the gaming app and top rating given to them
2. Most of the people does gave rating, those who gave rating most likly to gave 4+ rating.
3. Most of the adults installed social and communication apps.
4. Most of the apps installed by teens, in which Video Players and Editors category installation is more.
5. Size of the Applications varies the installations
6. People are mostly install the free apps, availabilty of free apps is also high
7. Teens have much engagement in terms of download and rating count.
